<h2 id="so-basically">So basically&hellip;</h2>
<p>I went to Cairns (in Australia) with my family recently and I want to share some of my favourite pictures.</p>
<p><em>I compressed all of the pictures and videos a bit because there were so many of them. I&rsquo;ve left higher resolution files <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/2ngygZgA#X-waMdcwdM10r8YcVXLu3Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p>
<h1 id="drone-shots">Drone shots</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show these first to grab your attention.</p>
<p>So we were walking along the beach at Palm Cove and I saw that the tide was pretty low that afternoon. It was so low that I could see land between the two islands in the ocean, Double Island and Haycock Island.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/double-island-haycock-reef.jpg" alt="A picture of Double Island and Haycock Island, with Haycock Reef just barely visible" loading="lazy" height="418" width="800px"/>
<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/haycock-reef-google-earth.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Google Earth showing Palm Cove and Double Island" loading="lazy" height="389" width="700px"/>
<span class="figcaption">Google Earth screenshot for perspective</span>
<p>I was curious what that looked like from above and if it was now possible to walk from one of the islands to the other. Google Earth didn&rsquo;t have imagery taken during low tide, so I hurried back home and picked up my drone so I could find out myself.</p>
<p>I flew it from the beach towards the island until we could just barely see the drone, then I took some photos, videos, and a panorama.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/haycock-reef.jpg" alt="A picture of Double Island, Haycock Island, and Haycock Reef from a drone perspective" loading="lazy" height="600px" width="800px"/>
<p>It seemed like the two islands were still separate, but it was damn cool to see that through my own pictures.</p>
<iframe class="pannellum" allowfullscreen style="border-style:none; display:block;" src="https://cdn.pannellum.org/2.5/pannellum.htm#panorama=https://mat383.com/images/cairns-holiday-photos/palm-cove-panorama.jpg"></iframe>
<p>I probably could&rsquo;ve gotten closer to the islands if I took off from further down the beach, near the jetty.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of the flight log, the flight path is in blue and I think the green circle is the distance limit that&rsquo;s hard-coded into the drone. I didn&rsquo;t end up going that far from land actually.</p>

<h1 id="green-stuff-on-the-rocks-at-the-beach">Green stuff on the rocks at the beach</h1>
<p>When we were up at Port Douglas, the family stopped at a playground as they were fatigued from all our wandering around town. I, however, had no need for rest. I wanted to occupy myself, but I was too mature for the playground there; I am a very serious and grown-up adult now.</p>
<p>In the distance, I saw a bunch of green rocks on the beach.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/seaweed-on-rocks-1.jpg" alt="Rocks covered with seaweed on the beach" loading="lazy" height="470px" width="800px"/>
<p>&ldquo;Now that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense&rdquo;, I thought. That looks like moss, but moss normally grows in moist and shady places, not on sunny shores.</p>
<p>As I cautiously approached the weird moss, I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t actually moss <em>(gasp)</em>.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/seaweed-on-rocks-2.jpg" alt="Closeup of rocks covered with seaweed on the beach" loading="lazy" height="525" width="700px"/>
<p>It was actually seaweed!</p>

<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/seaweed-on-rocks-4.jpg" alt="Closeup of rocks covered with seaweed on the beach" loading="lazy" height="714" width="600px"/>
<p>Well of course it was seaweed, I was on a beach. I don&rsquo;t know why that surprised me&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another picture.</p>

<h1 id="woah-clouds-look-like-that-now">Woah clouds look like that now</h1>
<p>My sister wanted to go out for an early morning walk with me once, at 6am or something like that. Her goal was to see the sunrise from the beach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally get out of bed that early, let alone step foot outside the house, but I said sure. Just this once, since we&rsquo;ve come all the way to Cairns.</p>
<p>As soon as we got to Palm Cove Beach, I noticed that the horizon looked strange.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-2.jpg" alt="Clouds covering a sunrise" loading="lazy" height="600" width="800px"/>
<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-1.jpg" alt="Clouds covering a sunrise" loading="lazy" height="600" width="800px"/>
<p>It was as if the distant mountains that we saw during the day extended to cover the entire horizon.</p>
<p>I blinked twice, then realised those were actually just low clouds in front of the soon-to-rise sun. Because I never go for walks this early on the beach, this was the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen something like this. It was beautiful.</p>
<p><video src="/videos/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-sunrise.mp4" controls  preload="metadata"></video></p>
<p>For a brief few minutes, there was also a small hole in the clouds right in front of the rising sun. It looked like a magic door thing.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-4.jpg" alt="Clouds covering a sunrise" loading="lazy" height="312" width="800px"/>
<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-5.jpg" alt="Clouds covering a sunrise" loading="lazy" height="525" width="700px"/>
<p>We both sat down next to the jetty and waited for the sun to rise. It didn&rsquo;t take long, but I enjoyed the little time we spent waiting. Sitting there in front of the waves on a chilly and bright morning had very peaceful vibes.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-6.jpg" alt="A sunrise on the beach" loading="lazy" height="525" width="700px"/>
<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/clouds-7.jpg" alt="A sunrise on the beach" loading="lazy" height="525" width="700px"/>
<p>After the sunrise, the clouds that detailed the horizon faded away and only the mountains remained. I&rsquo;m super glad to have experienced that view. Thanks, sis.</p>

<h1 id="bird-world">Bird world</h1>
<p>There was a bird world at Kuranda called Birdworld Kuranda and we went there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say about this one, but it was very cool. I&rsquo;ve been to a few of these bird sanctuary places before and this one was definitely up there.</p>
<p>I think the same company that runs this attraction also owns the butterfly sanctuary next-door. That&rsquo;s also a very cool place. I&rsquo;d say both of them are worth a visit.</p>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/birdworld.jpg" alt="Scenic view of Kuranda Birdworld" loading="lazy" height="600" width="800px"/>
<br>
<img src="/images/cairns-holiday-photos/birdworld-birds-1.jpg" alt="Birds in a tree in Kuranda Birdworld" loading="lazy" height="403" width="700px"/>
<p>If you were to go here, I&rsquo;d highly recommend you buy a bag of bird feed for $3 from the counter. Before we did, the birds didn&rsquo;t care about our presence <strong>at all</strong>. The Birdworld Kuranda experience is completely different if they notice you have food. They&rsquo;ll be all over you.</p>

<p>There was also this lone turtle in the water below.</p>

<br>
<video src="/videos/cairns-holiday-photos/birdworld-turtle.mp4" controls  preload="metadata"></video>
<p>I felt kind of bad for them. They were the slowest animal in the whole sanctuary and probably the only one that couldn&rsquo;t fly ;(</p>
<h1 id="assorted-pics">Assorted pics</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any cool stories for the rest of these images, but I found them neat.</p>
